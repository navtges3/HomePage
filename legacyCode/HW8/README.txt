In this assignment I was able to create draggable and droppable fields. When a tile is
dropped onto a droppable field the letter is read from the tile and displayed to the user.
when the user has played the words that they wish the can hit the submit button and then
the board will reset and their score will be compared to the high score which is always
visible. As of now I have not been able to implement what I need to validate if the words
are actual words.
