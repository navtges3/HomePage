  91.61 Assignment: Bootstrap and GitHub
  Nicholas E. Avtges, Umass Lowell Computer Science, nicholas_avtges@student.uml.edu
  Created 9/28/2020
  For this assignment I took the content that I created in Homework 2 and introduced
  bootstrap to the html programming. To improve my website I use a jumbotron for my
  name and email at the top. Then I used one row with three columns to seperate the
  main content so that it stays seperated even on smaller screens. To add a little
  something else I turned my unordered lists into list-groups to add a visual aspect
  to the lists.

              <h2><ins>About Me</ins></h2>
	            <p>Hello my name is Nick Avtges.</p>
	            <p>I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. My major is in Computer Science and I have a minor in Mathematics. I expect to be graduating in the winter of 2020.</p>
              <p>Outside of school I am the president of the Swim and Dive club and spend my free time with friends.</p>
	            <p>For a future coreer I am interested in seeking positions in software development with a focus on the medical device industry. For experience in this field, I have spent the last four years working for two medical device companies as a summer intern. MedRobotics was the first company where I worked as a research and developement intern. I then spent the next three summers working at Activ Surgical where I worked on projects ranging from robotic control to system debugging.</p>
              <p>Over the years I have been exposed to many programming languages. I am proficient in C, C++, java, and Arduino. The other langages which I have been exposed to are C#, python, html, and css.</p>
