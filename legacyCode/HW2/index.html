           <h2><ins>About Me</ins></h2>
	         <p>Hello my name is Nick Avtges.<br>
	            I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. My major is in Computer Science and I have a minor in Mathematics. I expect to be graduating in the winter of 2020.<br><br>
                    Outside of school I am the president of the Swim and Dive club and spend my free time with friends.<br><br>
	            For a future coreer I am interested in seeking positions in software development with a focus on the medical device industry. For experience in this field, I have spent the last four years working for two medical device companies as a summer intern. MedRobotics was the first company where I worked as a research and developement intern. I then spent the next three summers working at Activ Surgical where I worked on projects ranging from robotic control to system debugging.<br><br>
              Over the years I have been exposed to many programming languages. I am proficient in C, C++, java, and Arduino. The other langages which I have been exposed to are C#, python, html, and css.
